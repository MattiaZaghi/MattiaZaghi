### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-I'm an hybrid computational biologist with 4 years of experience in experimental genomics and 3 years of experience in computational anlysis of genomics data (bulk and single cell)

-I have extensive experience in analyzing different types of epigenomic datasets (ATAC-seq,ChIP-seq,Cut&Tag,HiC,scATAC-seq)

-I mostly use R language based packages to analyze and visualize data
